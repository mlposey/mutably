## The Scoop
Mutably is a tool for learning natural languages. It bridges the gaps between
the concepts you know and their slight variations.

## Roadmap
Development is currently focused on verb conjugation. The task of conjugating
verbs is naturally suited towards voice technology, so this feature could provide
much benefit to language learners. Front-end implementations could be done
for Alexa or voice-controlled mobile applications. In any case, two things are
needed first:
1. A method of conjugating verbs for a set of languages.
2. A common API for the front-end applications.
